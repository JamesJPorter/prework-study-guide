# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- The prework study guide is born of the need to be take notes effectively and to practice the skills learned while doing so. 
- In building a web page as a study guide, I reinforce the skills I am taking notes about as I learn them. 
- The Prework Study Guide provides a repository of learend knowledge to be referred to at a later date. 
- In the Prework Study Guide I learned how to:
 - Setup my IDE including GitBash, GitHub, VS Code and my file strucutre. 
 - Write and format HTML, link external CSS style sheets and JS files
 - Write in CSS, shaping and styling my HTML 
 - Code in basic JavaScript including For loops, If statements, to wrap both of these in functions and what control flow is / how it dictates JS functioning. 
 - How to operate with version control using Git and GitHub, creating working branches, staging (adding) them, commits, pull and push, merging branches and moving through the whole Git flow. 
 - Finally, I am learning how to deply my project and ensure I have this high quality and professional README.md.
