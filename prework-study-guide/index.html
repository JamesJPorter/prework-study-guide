          <li>.class is how you select for class with CSS. An element must be given a class within your HTML in order to select it with &ltclass=*class name*&gt</li>
          <li>CSS can be written in line, which is not advised as it does not allow for easy style adjustment. It can also be used as an internal style sheet which lives in your &ltheader&gt. The best way to utilzie CSS is to utilzie an external style sheet. External style sheets allow you to style entire elements, elements with specific class tags, ID's and a variety of other selector methods.</li>
          <li>CSS spruces up your website. Without it you would still be coding in 1995.</li>
