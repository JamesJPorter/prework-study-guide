          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Checking your code often for bugs is often as simple as opening your code in a web browser.</li>
          <li>HTML is simple and easy, providing strucutre to your page with no semantic elements such as BR or P, but also includes the actual content of your project, if without any style or functionality.</li>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
          <li>.class is how you select for class with CSS. An element must be given a class within your HTML in order to select it with &ltclass=*class name*&gt</li>
          <li>CSS can be written in line, which is not advised as it does not allow for easy style adjustment. It can also be used as an internal style sheet which lives in your &ltheader&gt. The best way to utilzie CSS is to utilzie an external style sheet. External style sheets allow you to style entire elements, elements with specific class tags, ID's and a variety of other selector methods.</li>
          <li>CSS spruces up your website. Without it you would still be coding in 1995.</li>

          <li>Of core importance in JavaScript is control flow. Items in JavaScript are order dependent. if you define a variable AFTER attempting to recall it, the code will generate an error. The same goes for a function which requires access to a variable or the calling of a function prior to its being written.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. After a function there should always be parenthese ().</li>
          <li>An Array is a group of related data, though the data can come in multiple typers such as a boolean, number or string.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
